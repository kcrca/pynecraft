            Writing data packs requires handling a lot of details, from putting things in the right folders in the
            correct
            format, to how those things are expressed in the first place. All errors are discovered during reload, or
            possibly at
            run time, rather than when you're editing the files in the first place.
        <p>
            In contrast, Python (and other real programming languages) have syntax checkers, errors for misspelled
            function names,
            IDEs that do auto-completion and checks for improper data types. And of course you have
            basic programming language tools, like functions with parameters that generate similar output for varying
            input, and loops that do things across multiple inputs.
        <p>
            <code>pynecraft</code> is a Python package that lets you create a data pack and its functions in Python,
            so you can take advantage of all this.
            It represents the data pack as an object that understands much of the layout of the data pack, and
            provides ways to generate commands inside functions from within Python, as well as JSON files all
	    around the datapack. This means you have all the power
            of a real programming language to generate your commands, including syntax and other error checks, python
            functions that generate minecraft commands that can be used in minecraft functions. And pynecraft also knows
            where to store what files in a data pack, and how to generate some boilerplate, like the
            <code>pack.mcmeta</code>.
        <p>
            As a simple example, the following is a "hello_world" data pack:
        <pre>
	    pack = DataPack('hello_world')
	    pack.function_set.add(Function('hello').add(say('Hello, World!')))
	    pack.save(minecraft_world)
	    </pre>
        We create a DataPack object, and add a Function to it. That function has, as its sole command, the result of
        calling <code>say</code>, which is a pynecraft function that returns a minecraft <code>say</code> command with
        the provided string. We add
        it to the function <code>hello_world:hello</code> inside the <code>hello_world</code> data pack. Any
        number of commands can be added at once, or any other time before the <code>save()</code>, which writes out the data
        pack files to a specified directory.
        <p>
	If 'minecraft_world' is a minecraft world save, the <code>save()</code> method will create:
        <pre>
	    minecraft_world
	    |-- datapacks
		|-- hello_world
		    |-- README                 # A generated warning not to edit this by hand
		    |-- pack.mcmeta
		    |-- data
			|-- functions
			    |-- hello.mcfunction
				"say Hello, World!"
	    </pre>
        <p>
            Pynecraft also has simple calls for obscure or complex minecraft mechanisms. For example, there is a
            Score class that holds the definition of a score (name and objective). You can use it as a parameter
	    to commands like <code>scoreboard</code>, but more importantly, it has methods to generate commands simply,
	    such as <code>score.add(15)</code> to generate <code>scoreboard players add <i>player objective</i> 15</code>.
        <p>
            Other examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Item.of(<i>block</i>)</code>, which returns the NBT required to store an item including its state
                and data as (say) an item you would summon into the world to be picked up by a player
            <li>
                The <code>Sign</code> class that generates all the messy NBT to set sign texts and commands, so
		<p>
                <ol>
                    <code>Sign((None, 'hi', 'there'), (tell(p(), 'Hello!'),)).place((0, 100, 0), WEST)</code>
                </ol>
		<p>
                which gives a list of three lines of text for the sign and one <code>tell</code> command, generates the lovely…
		<p>
                <ol>
                    <code>setblock 0 100 0 oak_sign[rotation=4]{front_text: {messages: ['{"text": "", "clickEvent":
                        {"action": "run_command", "value": "/tell @p Hello!"}}', '{"text": "hi"}', '{"text":
                        "there"}', '{"text": ""}']}}</code>
                </ol>
		<p>
                …a command that places an oak sign facing west at 0 100 0 with three lines of text which, when touched by the
                player, tells them "Hello!" (in case you couldn't decode all that NBT). (Actually it generates two commands, the
                first of which sets that block to <code>air</code>, to work around the fact that setting a sign at a
                place sometimes will
                not overwrite an existing sign, which is another thing you'd probably prefer not to worry about, and pynecraft takes
		care of for you.)
        </ul>

        You can find more details in the <a href='https://pynecraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#'>module documentation</a>.
        There is also an example in the source
        for a simple pack that warns users who are standing on dangerous blocks. There are also two other projects of mine
	that use pynecraft, one simple (<a href="https://github.com/kcrca/megavillage/tree/main/megavillage">megavillage</a>)
        and one very complex (<a href="https://github.com/kcrca/restworld/tree/main/restworld">RestWorld</a>, not for
        the faint of heart).

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        Installing is easy, it's a standard python package hosted at pypi.com, installed in the standard way:
        <pre>
	pip install pynecraft
	</pre>

        <h2>A Note</h2>
        Pynecraft was created to support my <a href="/restworld">RestWorld project</a>, which uses functions and tags
        heavily. I have rarely used other parts of data packs, so there is only trivial support for anything else &mdash; loot
        tables, advancements, etc. I am more than willing to take on collaborators or advice about
        what to do with these areas to expand support for them. Please contact me, either via the <a
            href="https://discord.gg/ksmuc4qqvy">discord</a> or by
        <a href="https://github.com/kcrca/pynecraft/issues">filing a support ticket</a>.

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        Here are some useful resources:

                project</a>, a simple

            <li><a href="https://github.com/kcrca/restworld/tree/main/restworld">The <code>RestWorld</code> project</a>,
                a very complex use
                that is the original target, whose <a href="/restworld/">very own website is here</a>.
        </ul>


        <h2>Finally…</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote pynecraft because I was working on my <a href="restworld/">RestWorld resource pack test world</a>.
            It makes extensive use of functions and command blocks, and after using a macro system to generate things for a
            while, it was clear that this was ugly and difficult. So I created pynecraft to make it easier, and it made a big
            difference. The "saying what I mean to say" stage of development nearly entirely vanished. I still had bugs and made
            mistakes, out they were almost never typos or command syntax problems. And with some of the simplification tools, I
            also stopped making mistakes about how relatively complicated things were done.

        <p>
            After using this for a year or so, I want to make it available to others, so enjoy! Let me know what you
            think at either the <a href="https://discord.gg/ksmuc4qqvy">discord</a>, or the
            <a href="https://github.com/kcrca/pynecraft/issues">bug/feature link</a>!
